# Intercity-Buses-Automation
I have prepared a project that can handle all the needs of an intercity buses ticket buying automation.
When the staff login as admin, it can use all the usage areas. For the city to be visited, the bus is chosen according to the date and time. The staff can display the empty and filled seats on their screen. When the ticket is received, the system is updated and the received seat is shown as full. Only the admin can modify or delete.
This project is made with using C# Programming Language and MSSQL as a database.
